# [Cypress Ultimate Example]

> Vue.js codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) spec and API.

Project demo is available at https://vue-vuex-realworld.netlify.app/

This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with **Vue.js** including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the **Vue.js** community styleguides & best practices.

For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.

## How to run the frontend application to be testes

```bash
# install editorconfig globally
> npm install -g editorconfig
```

The stack is built using [vue-cli webpack](https://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack) so to get started all you have to do is:

```bash
# install dependencies
> yarn install
# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
> yarn serve
```

Other commands available are:

```bash
# build for production with minification
yarn run build

# run unit tests
yarn test
```
